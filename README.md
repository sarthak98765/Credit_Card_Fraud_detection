# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements a **Credit Card Fraud Detection** system using machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions. The notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training to achieve effective fraud detection.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding data patterns.
- Data preprocessing with scaling and handling class imbalance.
- Model training using various machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
